1. weird behaviour as follows:
   after server has been running awhile, websocket updates do not have anything in them (added:{},changed:{},deleted:{})
AND on refresh end up with duplicate values in the array

2. hammertime broke somewhere

3. need the ability to address photo view so that if you click on a photo it can start on that one

   user/photos -> starts at the 1st photo
   user/photos/photoid -> starts at the photoidth photo
